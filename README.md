# Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix

This repository is code developed along with the excellent book *Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix* by Lance Halvorsen. For the most part, the code follows along with the book but has been modified to:

* Include thorough documentation and typespecs
* Fully comply with Dialyzer and Credo in strict mode and some check modifications
* Convert the IEx sessions in the book to tests
* Clean up or update some of the code in the book
* Use structs more thoroughly than in the book and add in custom types for more domain driven development
